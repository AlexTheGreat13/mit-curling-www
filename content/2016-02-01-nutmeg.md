MIT continued on the #RoadToChaska by sending a team to the Nutmeg College Bonspiel. The tournament was hosted by Yale in Bridgeport, CT on January 29-31, 2016.

MIT began with a close win over RPI that went to an extra end, triumphing 11-10. After losing to Penn on Saturday morning, the team went on a 3-0 run, defeating Colgate (vice Alex Hull's alma mater), RPI, and Yale. This impressive run meant that MIT won the C event at the Bonspiel, and earned a healthy chunk of merit points for Nationals.
