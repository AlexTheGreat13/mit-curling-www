MIT sent a team to compete at the Crashspiel in Belfast, Maine on January 23-24, 2016 as the first bonspiel of the New Year. Only three members were able to attend: lead Nate Bailey, vice Alex Hull, and skip Greg Dooley.

The team lost its first game on Saturday morning to the hosting Bowdoin first team, before defeating UMaine and a mixed Yale/Penn team. Due to tiebreakers, this meant that MIT faced Yale in the B event finals on Sunday morning. Unfortunately, an early deficit against Yale was compounded by a bad miss on a takeout that would have tied the game at 4-4, but instead dug an even deeper hole. MIT finished the event as B event runners-up.
