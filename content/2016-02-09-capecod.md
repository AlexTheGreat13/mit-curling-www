Bowdoin hosted a 1-day College Curling Bonspiel at Cape Cod Curling Club this past Saturday, and MIT sent a team to compete. The team consisted of lead Sami Khan, second Nate Bailey, vice Cody Karcher, and skip Greg Dooley. With only this and next week's Utica College Bonspiel before the cutoff for Nationals-qualifying events, it was important for the MIT team to do well here and lock up a spot as one of the 16 teams at Nationals.

The day began with a 10:30am game against cross-Cambridge rivals Harvard. Despite only playing with 3 players, Harvard was able to run up a big lead in the first 3 ends of the game before MIT got on the board in the 4th end. However, because of the 6-end games played at this Bonspiel, MIT had no chance to come back and started the tournament with a loss.

After a quick lunch, MIT took the ice again at 12:30 to play the tournament hosts, Bowdoin. With much improved play from lead Sami Khan, MIT was able to start this game off quickly, amounting a large lead and eventually the win. The next game at 2:30 against Yale followed roughly the same script, and MIT finished the quick event with a 2-1 record and 5 points towards qualifying for Nationals.
