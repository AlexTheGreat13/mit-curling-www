MIT was able to send 3 teams to the Broomstones college bonspiel hosted at our home curling club in Wayland, MA this past weekend. Alex Hull, Cody Karcher, and Nate Bailey, who competed in last year's Nationals, each led a separate team as skip. The rest of the teams were all new curlers who just started this academic year. Although the teams didn't win that many games, the experience gained by the team will surely help in future tournaments.

Team Alex consisted of Alex himself, Kevin Wang, Ike Urquhart, and a player from Boston University. Team Nate included Yaroslav Babich, Kelsey Becker, and Inderraj Grewal. Team Cody included Kika Arias, Trevor Spreadbury, and Mathew Ganatra.

Team Cody was the only team to win games on the weekend, with two strong victories against Colgate University and MIT's own Team Nate. They faced Bowdoin in the C event finals on Sunday morning, and after tying 6-6 in regulation, lost in the skip stones tiebreaker.

The event was live streamed on YouTube by Broomstones Curling Club. Here are the links to Sunday's games:

Many thanks to Broomstones Curling Club for running a great event. MIT's next bonspiel will be the RPI Bonspiel in early December.
