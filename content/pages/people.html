      <div class="officer-bio">
        Nate is a graduate student in Transportation (part of the Civil and Environmental Engineering department), planning to finish his Master's Degree in May 2016 and continue into the Interdepartmental Doctoral Program in Transportation and obtain a Ph.D. His research focuses on traffic simulation of autonomous vehicles and developing ways to improve traffic management once they are deployed in urban areas. Nate completed his undergrad at UC Berkely in Spring 2014. After moving from the warm climate of California to the less-warm climate of Boston, Nate began curling in his first semester at MIT in Fall 2014 and quickly fell in love with the sport.

      <div class="officer-bio">
        Kelsey was born in the frozen wasteland of North Dakota.  Hoping to put her 19 years of walking on ice to use, she decided to join the MIT Curling Team.  Kelsey is a Management and Comparative Media Studies major with a minor in Political Science.  She fills her time at MIT as chairman of the Lecture Series Committee, president of the Association of Student Activities, and various roles within the MacGregor House Committee.  However, her heart and soul is dedicated to being the Curling Club’s Treasurer.

She started curling her freshman year at MIT and since then has developed a curling obsession. When she isn’t curling, Kika mentors students in the MIT Makerlodge and enjoys baking and painting nails.

      <div class="officer-name"><h4>Alex Hull</h4></div>
      <div class="officer-bio">
        Alex started curling in 2011 as a sophomore at Colgate University in upstate New York. He was lucky enough to join college curling at a time when enthusiasm for the sport was taking off, both at Colgate and throughout the northeast, and he has been addicted ever since. After graduation in 2014, Alex moved to MIT (which he obviously chose for its competitive curling program), and his dual loyalty is something that the Colgate and MIT teams constantly give him a hard time about. When not curling, Alex is a student in the Department of Chemistry, trying to use small molecule, gas phase spectroscopy to better understand reactions in the Earth's atmosphere. He is also a big fan of Red Sox baseball and (like all good CT natives) UConn basketball, and enjoys swimming and hiking when the weather warms up.

      <div class="officer-bio">
        Trevor started curling in his freshman year at MIT after numerous failed attempts to curl around his hometown of Hometown, Illinois. An undergraduate student studying Computer Science and/or Mathematics, Trevor is interested in all of the ways in which computers can be used to improve peoples' lives. When he's not curling, Trevor spends his time playing table tennis, traveling, reading Wikipedia, neglecting the curling website, and listening to music.

      </div>
      <div class="officer-name"><h4>Phillip Nadeau</h4></div>
      <div class="officer-bio">
        Phillip is a Canadian graduate student in Electrical Engineering at MIT. He twice competed in the USA College National Curling Championships, with a Gold Medal win for MIT in Chicago in 2011 as vice for skip Dave Tax, and Bronze in Duluth in 2013 as skip himself. While many young Canadians looked to great NHL-ers like Wayne Gretzky for inspiration, yet others, like Phillip, were aspiring curlers hoping to one day become the next Brier Champion. Growing up and moving to the USA for graduate school, he thought his curling days were surely numbered, but to his amazement, he found a strong and growing curling culture in the Boston/New England area. As curling has grown in popularity with its inclusion as an Winter Olympics sport, he enjoys sharing his passion for this life-long game with others. See you out on the ice eh!

      <div class="officer-name"><h4>David Tax</h4></div>
      <div class="officer-bio">
        David is a graduate student in Electrical Engineering. He has curled for a number of years out of the Mayflower Curling Club in Halifax, Nova Scotia, Canada, where he (supposedly) lead teams to victory several nights a week. David skipped the MIT team at the College Curling National Championships several times, including a win in 2011. Aside from curling, like any true Canadian, his passion is hockey. David has developed into an avid Bruins fan since his arrival in Boston and can be found at most home games... that is when he's not actually out playing hockey or curling. When the ice melts, David resorts to playing pretentious games like golf and tennis.
