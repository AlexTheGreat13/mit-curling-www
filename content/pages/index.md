The MIT Curling Club is an ASA-recognized student group that... well... goes curling. All MIT students are welcome to join regardless of skill or experience. Interested students from other nearby schools that don't have a curling program should also feel free to contact us by emailing [the officers mailing list](mailto:curling-owner@mit.edu).

Our main activities include:

* Weekly curling practice during the season running from mid-October through the end of March. Practice is held on Fridays and typically lasts from 3:00-7:30pm.
* Introductory events each semester to introduce those unfamiliar with the sport to the basics of curling.
* Competition in college bonspiels both regionally with other schools in the Northeast and nationally at the [US College Curling National Championships](www.collegecurlingusa.org).

If you are interested in joining, simply [contact us](/contact) and we will add you to the mailing list.
