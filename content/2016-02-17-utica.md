MIT sent a team to the Utica College Bonspiel hosted by Hamilton, Colgate, and SUNY Poly at the Utica Curling Club in Utica, NY this past weekend. Second Nate Bailey, Vice Cody Karcher, and Skip Alex Hull were joined by Lead Emily Jacobs from Colgate University. The tournament started with a loss to SUNY Poly 1, followed by a win against Hamilton, a second loss to SUNY Poly 2, and finally a win in the F event finals against RIT 2.

The Utica spiel was the final tournament that counted towards qualification for the 2016 College Curling National Championships. Today, the <a href="http://www.collegecurlingusa.org/" target="_blank">final standings</a> were released, and MIT squeaked into the 15th slot out of 16. This means that MIT will be sending a team to compete in the College Curling National Championships in Chaska, MN from March 11-13. It was a great season both for MIT Curling and for the sport of college curling, and we're excited to represent our team!
